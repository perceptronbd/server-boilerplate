Welcome to the MERN Stack E-commerce project! We're excited to have you participate in our coding challenge. Your task is to solve the provided use cases, which will be assessed based on your understanding of DSA concepts, your ability to work with the MERN stack, and your problem-solving skills.

## Getting Started  
### Step 1: Clone the Repository  
First, clone the provided repository to your local machine. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:` 

### Step 2: Create Branches for Each Use Case  
For each use  case you are assigned,  create a new branch in the repository. This is  where you will implement your solution.  To  create a branch,  use the following command:
   ` bash git checkout -b  <branch-name>`

 Replace `<branch-name>` with the name  of your branch. The branch name should follow the format `[initial of the candidates name]-[issue number]`. For example,  if your name  is John Doe and you are working on issue number 1, your branch name should be `JD-1`. 
### Step  3: Implement Your Solution 
Implement the solution for the assigned use  case  in your branch. Make sure to follow the project's coding standards and guidelines.  
### Step  4: Commit Your Changes 
Once you have implemented your solution, commit your changes. Use the following commands to add your changes to the staging area  and commit them:
`bash git add . git commit -m "Implemented solution for use case X"`

 Replace `"Implemented solution for use case X"` with a meaningful commit message that describes your changes. 
### Step  5: Push Your Branch to the Remote Repository 
After committing your changes, push your branch to the remote repository using the following command:
`bash git push origin  <branch-name>`

Replace `<branch-name>` with the name  of your branch. 
### Step  6: Create a Pull Request 
Once your branch is pushed to the remote repository,  go  to the GitHub page of the repository and create a new pull request. Make sure to  select your branch as the source and the main branch as the destination. In the pull request description, mention the issue as `#[issue-number]`, provide a brief overview of the changes you made and the use  case you implemented. 
### Step  7: Review and Submit Your Pull Request 
After creating your pull request, review your changes and ensure that everything is correct. Once you are satisfied with your solution, submit your pull request. 
### Additional Notes

- Ensure your code is clean, well-documented,  and follows the project's coding standards.  
-   If you encounter any issues or have questions, feel free to reach out  to us. 
We look forward to reviewing your solutions and learning more about your skills and approach to problem-solving. 
**`Happy Hacking!`**
